\section{Motor Learning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item for simplifying discussion introducing classification of movements and motor tasks.
	\item 2 important classification schemes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item based on particular movements made: discrete, continuous, serial
		\item based on perceptual attributes of the task: open/closed
	\end{itemize}
	\item \underline{discrete movements}
\end{itemize}
