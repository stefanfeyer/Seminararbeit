With the improvements of Mixed Reality technology, motor learning in Mixed Reality has become a major topic in commercial companies and academic research. In the real world, guidance always takes place in the exo-centric perspective, but with Mixed Reality technology, ego-centric guidance becomes possible. While motor learning in mixed reality proofed to perform well, we know very little about the influence of the visual perspective on a guidance visualisation. This work focusses on the background of these topics with the aim to design a study which will be able to deliver data to investigate the influence of four different visual perspectives. This will lead to insights on which visual perspective to use for motor learning. The result of this work is a within-subject study design with four visual perspectives as conditions.
