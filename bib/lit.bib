Observation is the very first step to copy the motion of instructor when at the beginning of learning sports of artisanship. However, beginners face difficulties in imitating at the start since they do not have somesthetic image of the movement. In order to help learning physical skills, we propose Immersive virtual environment using head mounted display that indicates 3D motion of instructor super imposed on learner's body. By using this system, learners try to match its own form to instructor's 3D model to imitate instructor's motion from first person view in virtual environment. At the early stage of this research, we tried to transfer pitching skill in baseball. We evaluated the effectiveness of proposed system by measuring throwing distance.},

This platform acts like a virtual teacher that transfers the knowledge of five Tai-Chi movements using feed-back stimuli to compensate the errors committed by a user during the performance of the gesture. The fundamental components of this multimodal interface are the gesture recognition system (using k-means clustering, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) and Finite State Machines (FSM)) and the real-time descriptor of motion which is used to compute and qualify the actual movements performed by the student respect to the movements performed by the master, obtaining several feedbacks and compensating this movement in real-time varying audio-visualtactile parameters of different devices. The experiments of this multimodal platform have confirmed that the quality of the movements performed by the students is improved significantly.},

abstract = {A carefully planned, structured, and supervised physiotherapy program, following a surgery, is crucial for the successful diagnosis of physical injuries. Nearly 50 {\%} of the surgeries fail due to unsupervised, and erroneous physiotherapy. The demand for a physiotherapist for an extended period is expensive to afford, and sometimes inaccessible. Researchers have tried to leverage the advancements in wearable sensors and motion tracking by building affordable, automated, physio-therapeutic systems that direct a physiotherapy session by providing audio-visual feedback on patient's performance. There are many aspects of automated physiotherapy program which are yet to be addressed by the existing systems: a wide classification of patients' physiological conditions to be diagnosed, multiple demographics of the patients (blind, deaf, etc.), and the need to pursue patients to adopt the system for an extended period for self-care. In our research, we have tried to address these aspects by building a health behavior change support system called KinoHaptics, for post-surgery rehabilitation. KinoHaptics is an automated, wearable, haptic assisted, physio-therapeutic system that can be used by a wide variety of demographics and for various physiological conditions of the patients. The system provides rich and accurate vibro-haptic feedback that can be felt by the user, irrespective of the physiological limitations. KinoHaptics is built to ensure that no injuries are induced during the rehabilitation period. The persuasive nature of the system allows for personal goal-setting, progress tracking, and most importantly life-style compatibility. The system was evaluated under laboratory conditions, involving 14 users. Results show that KinoHaptics is highly convenient to use, and the vibro-haptic feedback is intuitive, accurate, and has shown to prevent accidental injuries. Also, results show that KinoHaptics is persuasive in nature as it supports behavior change and habit building. The successful acceptance of KinoHaptics, an automated, wearable, haptic assisted, physio-therapeutic system proves the need and future-scope of automated physio-therapeutic systems for self-care and behavior change. It also proves that such systems incorporated with vibro-haptic feedback encourage strong adherence to the physiotherapy program; can have profound impact on the physiotherapy experience resulting in higher acceptance rate.},

The method combines elements of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and various Dynamic Programming Alignment (DPA) methods, such as edit distance, sequence alignment, and dynamic time warping. As opposed to existing approaches which treat HMM and DPA as either competing or complementing methods, we provide a common framework which allows us to combine ideas from both HMM and DPA research. The combined approach takes on the robustness and effectiveness of HMMs and the simplicity of DPA approaches. We have implemented and successfully tested the proposed algorithm on various gesture data.},

The present study examines the effect of dynamic viewpoint tethering on performance, with respect to both local guidance and global awareness measures, in comparison with three conventional display formats: egocentric, exocentric and rigidly tethered displays. Participants were instructed to control an aircraft-shaped cursor navigating in a virtual tunnel and to answer questions about the environment. The results confirmed that global awareness performance decreased with increased egocentricity in the display frame of reference. The two tethered displays (dynamic and rigid) supported the best local guidance performance. No significant performance differences were found between the two tethered displays.},

abstract = {Abstract In this research, the authors evaluate the degree to which dancers copy or follow the techniques of a master, or the degree of proficiency, by analyzing movements in traditional Japanese dance. The data used consist of three-dimensional time series for traditional Japanese dance movements acquired using optical motion capture system. In the authors' prior research, three moving coordinate systems which would move according to the translation and rotation of the body were used to extract the portion of the target movement. In this research, the authors consider a moving coordinate system which simultaneously takes into consideration translation, rotation, correction of orientation, and correction of waist tremble. In their prior research, the authors defined indices for movement stability and frequency characteristics as indices to quantitatively represent in an objective fashion the degree of proficiency of a dancer. Separate from this, in the current research the authors define an index with the spectrum component using a Gabor transform and an index for the amount of translation. The authors had a total of five people, a master from a particular dance school and four dance students of different genders and at different experience levels (all the master's students), perform dance experiments. The authors then extracted the target movements, measured the indices using the extraction results, and attempted to evaluate the degree of proficiency based on the proposed indices. Extraction was sufficiently precise, and the authors were able to confirm that the indices represent the differences appearing due to degree of proficiency and gender. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
