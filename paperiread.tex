VR dance trainer using motion capture
\begin{itemize}
	\item when the vr application is designed to adoped the motion capturing system, the interaction between the computer and the human users can be further enhanced
	\item maching two motions is an essentialn step in motion recognition. in motion matching, the similarities between each of the moteion templates and the input motions are computed. then, the input motion is recognised as the classof the motion template with the highest similarities. joint \underline{angles} are usually used in motion matching.
	\item waswurde evaluiert:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item performance: two motions are compared in: point position, velocity, joints angle
		\item user study
	\end{itemize}
	\item used fixed time for training 
\end{itemize}
